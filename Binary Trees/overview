Binary trees

- contain many nodes, which can point to other nodes
- we can store any value(s) in the nodes

Common terms

- parent nodes, child nodes (relative relationship) within a tree
- root: a node with no parent (at the top of the tree)
- leaf node: a node with no children (at the bottom of the tree)

Binary - the word has to do with the number 2

- a tree where every node has at most 2 children
- has exactly 1 root - a single root with no parent
- exactly 1 path between the root and any node
